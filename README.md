# Multi-Camera Robust Shape Interaction Matrix (McRSIM)
This code is implementation for the following paper:

Xikang Zhang, Bengisu Osbay, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps, Dynamics Enhanced Multi-Camera Motion Segmentation from Unsynchronized Videos, ICCV 2017.

## Introduction
We would like to perform motion segmentation on sequences from multi-cameras with the following conditions:
- Uncalibrated cameras
- Without correspondences across the view
- Without synchronization

## Results

## Prerequisites
To get experimental results of the paper, you need to download the following data sets:

- Hopkins 155 data set: http://www.vision.jhu.edu/data/hopkins155/
- Hopkins Additional Sequences with Missing data: http://vision.jhu.edu/data/
- RSL12 data set: http://robustsystems.coe.neu.edu/?q=content/publications

## Testing
The demo code is in the matlab folder. You may need to set up the correct path before running the code.

- testBenchmark.m: simulated Multi-camera Motion Segmentation on modified Hopkins 155 data set
- testBenchmark2.m: Multi-camera Motion Segmentation on RSL 12 data set
- testMissing.m: Single-camera Motion Segmentation on Hopkins 12 Real Motion Sequences with Incomplete data.
- testMissingMC.m: Multi-camera Motion Segmentation on Hopkins 12 Real Motion Sequences with Incomplete data, half trajectories rotated 45 degree as Camera 2.
- testGross.m: Single-camera Motion Segmentation on Hopkins 155 data set with gross contamination
- testGrossMC.m: Multi-camera Motion Segmentation on Hopkins 155 data set with gross contamination, half trajectories rotated 45 degree as Camera 2.
- testSingleCam.m: Single-camera Motion Segmentation on Hopkins 155 data set

## RSL60: extended benchmark data set
This is an extension of the RSL12 data set. We provide this to the community as a larger benchmark for multi-camera motion segmentation problem. It can be downloaded at http://robustsystems.coe.neu.edu/?q=content/publications.

The results of RSL60 with the same protocol of the paper are shown in the following table. To reproduce the results, please replace "RSL12" with "RSL60" in testBenchmark2.m.
